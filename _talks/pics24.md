AV talking about recent advancements in tractable probabilistic modeling: from [scaling probabilistic circuits](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ke40kfOT2E) to [realiable neuro-symbolic AI](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/c182ec594f38926b7fcb827635b9a8f4-Abstract-Conference.html) and to (hierarchical) [subtractive mixture models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xIHi5nxu9P). Divided in three lectures.
